Ultrasonic HC-SR04 diag.

So! We are working on a sensor for the garage, so we know in blinking colors how far we are from the steps in front of the car. Maybe we'll get the schematic of the circuit up but with the pin definitions, you  may be able to just figure it out. We are working with standalone ATMEGA328P's, but it's really not that much more difficult. There is a power supply necessary, and crystal oscillators among things, and the project is just about done. :)
